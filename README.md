## **Conflict Plan**
We will try as much as possible so that no disagreement arises among the members, as we have reduced the number of people responsible for a specific work and general decisions are within everyone's vote. But if an objection or disagreement arises, we will try to resolve it. Everyone agreed to submit to the opinion of the majority. If the problem is not resolved and no concessions are made, we will switch roles in the matter. Working so that those who disagreed with each other do not work on the same task and the TA is informed about this problem, but we will try as much as possible to solve the team’s problems internally. No one person alone will be able to take over the project. With them first, if there is no satisfactory response, they will be told that they will evaluate poorly, and this will affect their results, of course.

## **Communication Plan**
I will be available for communication from ***10 am to 3 pm*** and from ***10 pm to 12 pm***, All team members will communicate with each other on slack, trello, team viewer and discord. Breaks are not important for every group and person has a choice, the important thing is to finish the required work before the daily meeting begins at night, We will work at the end of the week so that we can finish early and avoid accidents, and the members who finish their tasks will help other colleagues until the work is done. The business is collective and everyone takes decisions in it. We started with this strategy. We held a vote to determine the idea of ​​the project. I also continue to monitor everyone and ask them about their opinions and others.
